# Git: Encryption & Cryptography

A brief aside...in setting up a secure connection with GitHub we used SSH. SSH (Secure Shell) creates encryption keys - similar to PGP or GPG if you've heard of those. You can use these keys to encrypt and decrypt messages. We won't do that here today, but you should know the following terms:

* A **public key** is a cryptographic key that can be obtained and used by anyone to encrypt messages intended for a particular recipient, such that the encrypted messages can be deciphered only by using a second key that is known only to the recipient (the **private key** ). - Source: Google?

If you're interested, here are some links you can check out. We'll skip these for now.
